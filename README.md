# Swarm-algorithms-and-use-in-optimisation

Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recent metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the swarming behavior of salps in oceans. It being an optimisation algorithm, I have used them to enhance the classification of a deep learning neural network.

Swarm-based algorithm can successfully avoid the local optimal constraints, thus achieving a smooth balance between exploration and exploitation.
